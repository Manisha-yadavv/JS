// const name = "Manisha"
// const language = "Javascript"
// console.log(name + language)     DON'T DO THIS, THIS SYNTAX IS OUTDATED
// console.log(`Hi, my name is ${name} and i am learning ${language}`)  THIS IS MODERN WAY (INTERPOLATION), THIS IS MORE READABLE

const gameName = new String("Manisha")
console.log(gameName)
